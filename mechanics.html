<h2>The Game Mechanics</h2>
<p>First are the game mechanics these types of mechanics are in every action game but for these soulslike games these actions take time putting more empahsis on planning out these actions.
The standard actions a player has can be broken down into three things Dodging,Healing and Attacking.</p>
<h3>Dodging</h3>
<p>The dodge roll or dash has a set amount of invulnerablity frames that help you avoid attacks so its important that its time correctly to avoid getting hit</p>

<h3>Healing</h3>
<p>there is usually a unrepleshinable item the heal ailments like dodging this takes time and can leave you vulnerable if timed incorrectly </p>

<h3>Attacking</h3>
<p>then there is attacking which has a caveat attack animations take long times to finish if the attack button is spammed the game will queue all the imputs locking your character in the attacks animations
which can leave you very vulnerable </p>
